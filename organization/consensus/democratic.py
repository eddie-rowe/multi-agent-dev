    ## Group the responses by theme:
    ### Emotion/Connection (Lover, Caregiver, Jester)
    ### Logic/Insight (Sage, Magician, Creator)
    ### Order/Disorder (Ruler, Rebel, Explorer)
    ### Self/Belonging (Innocent, Everyman, Hero)
    ## Assign weight to each archetype based on the relevance of the situation.
    ## For example, if the question is deeply emotional, maybe the Lover and Caregiver get more say, while the Ruler or Hero might play a supporting role. You can use:
    ## 3 votes: Directly relevant archetypes
    ## 2 votes: Indirectly relevant
    ## 1 vote: Peripheral relevance
    ## Tally the emotional, logical, and practical leanings to detect the underlying current.
    ## Reflect on the full councilâ€™s input
    ## Integrate the tension and harmonies into a balanced perspective
    ## Offer a next step or insight, not a final answer
    ## This is your wise inner self, shaped by all your parts but not bound by any one.

    You make the final decision based on the majority vote.
